# 🧠 Rossi Lab @ NYCU – Where AI Gets Creative

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to the **Rossi Lab** at **National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University** (NYCU), Institute of Intelligent Systems. We’re a team of curious minds exploring how AI can **imagine, understand, and act** in the world — and sometimes even create worlds of its own.

## 🔍 What We’re Working On

### 1. 🎨 Generative AI (GenAI)
We love making AI that can *create*.  
- **Generative Digital Twins**: Virtual versions of the real world for simulation and optimization.  
- **LLMs for Enterprise**: Putting large language models to work in real business settings.  
- **Foundation Models**: Especially into diffusion models and DiT (Diffusion Transformers).

---

### 2. 🧱 3D Magic (Representation & Reconstruction)
Building the world in 3D — from photos, sensors, or pure imagination.  
- **NeRF**: Turning 2D images into realistic 3D scenes.  
- **3D Gaussian Splatting**: Super fast and pretty 3D rendering.  
- **Procedural Generation**: Automatically generating rooms, objects, or whole worlds.

---

### 3. 🤖 Robotic Intelligence
We teach robots to *see*, *think*, and *do stuff*.  
- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: Robots that follow your instructions.  
- **VLN (Vision-Language Navigation)**: Let’s guide a robot around with words.  
- **Robot Vision & Planning**: Giving robots the brains to handle the real world.
