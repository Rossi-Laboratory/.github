# 🧠 Rossi Lab @ NYCU  
### *Robotic Science, Systems, and Intelligence*

Welcome to the **Rossi Lab** at the **Institute of Intelligent Systems**, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)!  
We explore the frontiers of **Generative AI**, **3D Representation**, and **Robotic Intelligence** — combining science and creativity to build smarter machines and virtual worlds.

---

## 🔍 What We Do

### 1. 🎨 Generative AI (GenAI)
Making AI that *creates* and *understands*:
- **Generative Digital Twins**: Realistic virtual replicas for simulation and prediction.
- **LLMs for Enterprise**: Applying large language models to real-world industrial use.
- **Foundation Models**: We work with diffusion models and DiT (Diffusion Transformers) to push the limits of generative capabilities.

---

### 2. 🧱 3D Representation & Reconstruction
We bring the 3D world to life:
- **NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)**: Turning photos into immersive 3D scenes.
- **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)**: Real-time, photorealistic 3D rendering.
- **Procedural Generation**: Automatically generating objects, scenes, and environments for AI training and simulation.

---

### 3. 🤖 Robotic AI
Teaching robots to *see*, *think*, and *act*:
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Robots that understand commands and perform complex tasks.
- **Vision-Language Navigation (VLN)**: Natural language-driven navigation in dynamic spaces.
- **Robot Perception & Planning**: From sensing to decision-making in real-world scenarios.
